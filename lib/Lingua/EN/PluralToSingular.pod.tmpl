=head1 NAME

Lingua::EN::PluralToSingular - change an English plural to a singular

=head1 SYNOPSIS

[% example("synopsis") %]
    
=head1 VERSION

This documents [% info.colon %] version [% info.version %]
corresponding to git commit L<[% commit.commit %]|[% info.repo
%]/commit/[% commit.commit %]> released on [% commit.date %].

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This converts words denoting a plural in the English language into
words denoting a singular noun, and discriminates singulars and
plurals.

=head1 FUNCTIONS

=head2 to_singular

    my $singular = to_singular ($word);

Convert C<$word> into its singular form. For example,

    to_singular ('cats')

returns 'cat'. If the word is unknown or does not seem to be
plural, C<to_singular> returns the word itself, so

    to_singular ('battlehorn');

returns 'battlehorn'.

=head2 is_plural

    if (is_plural ($word)) {
        print "There are too many $word here.\n";
    }
    else {
        print "There is a $word here.\n";
    }

Returns 1 if the word is a valid plural, 0 if not. It also returns 1
for ambiguous words like "sheep".

=head1 LIMITATIONS AND CAVEATS

=head2 Assumes the input is a noun

L</to_singular> assumes its input is a noun. For example, "lives" may
be the plural of "life", or the verb "live", as in "he lives". The
routine assumes a noun and converts to "life".

=head2 Distinguishes lower and upper case

It does not deal with capitalized words. If the input word may be
capitalized, or if its initial letter may be capitalized, the user
must preprocess it to put it into the normal case. So, for example,

    to_singular ('FLIES');

returns 'FLIES' and

    to_singular ('Wolves');

returns 'Wolve'. Similarly,

    to_singular ('Charles');

returns 'Charles', but 

    to_singular ('charles');

returns 'charle', since the exception only applies if the word is
capitalized.

=head2 Does not handle pronouns

The module does not attempt to handle pronoun forms like "ourselves"
or "themselves". These words are left unaltered.

=head2 False plurals also accepted

For the sake of user convenience, false plurals like "octopi" are also
accepted by the module. (The plural of "octopus" is "octopuses".)

=head2 Not all exceptional plurals are included

There are many exceptions which have not been included, notably words
with Latin or Greek plurals.

=head1 STANDALONE SCRIPT

The script F<scripts/singular> provides a quick way to get singular
versions of nouns:

    singular cats dogs geese
    # Prints "cat dog goose".

=head1 EXPORTS

Both L</is_plural> and L</to_singular> are exported on demand. An
export tag C<:all> exports all the functions of the module:

    use Lingua::EN::PluralToSingular ':all';

The export tag C<:all> was added in version L</0.22>.

=head1 SEE ALSO

=over

=item Lingua::EN::Inflect

L<Lingua::EN::Inflect> by Damian Conway converts English singular
nouns to plurals, but not vice-versa.

=item Lingua::EN::Inflect::Number

L<Lingua::EN::Inflect::Number> is supposed to do the same thing as
this module. However, as of the time of writing (version 1.12) it's
actually based on the third-person verb handling of
Lingua::EN::Inflect, in other words it takes a verb in the "he says"
form and converts it into "say". Thus you get bugs like
L<https://rt.cpan.org/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=64564> where the
reporter demonstrates that 'to_S incorrectly renders the singular of
"statuses" as "statuse."'

=head1 ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS

Thanks to Xan Charbonnet and H2CHANG for various additions and fixes.
Lisa Hare contributed support for plurals ending in i as part of the
2016 Pull Request Challenge.

=head1 HISTORY

This module was originally written to address a defect in
L</Lingua::EN::Inflect> where it had no way to turn plurals into
singulars.

=over

=item 0.22

Added the C<:all> export tag.
